# Predictive Modelling in Healthcare

## Overview
This project focuses on large-scale predictive modeling in healthcare using Machine Learning techniques. 

The goal is to analyze Electronic Health Records (EHR) and structured clinical datasets to predict disease risk and perform patient risk assessment.

---

## Problem Statement
Healthcare institutions generate massive volumes of patient data. Extracting meaningful insights from this data can help in:

- Early disease detection
- Risk stratification
- Preventive healthcare planning
- Reducing hospital readmissions

This project builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict patient risk using structured healthcare data.
